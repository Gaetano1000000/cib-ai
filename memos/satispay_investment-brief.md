- Geography: Italy, with headquarters in Paris (Source 8)
- Revenue logic + pricing/take rate: Charges a flat merchant fee of €0.20 per transaction (Source 6)
- Scale signals: 6 million users (Source 1), 400,000 merchants (Source 1)
- Strongest signals: Valuation of $1.0 billion (Source 7), 900 employees (Source 7)

Clear stance: Needs Deeper Diligence

# 2) Business Model & Monetization Logic
Satispay generates revenue primarily through a flat fee of €0.20 charged to merchants for each transaction processed. This model is advantageous as it provides predictable revenue streams and is more cost-effective for businesses compared to traditional credit card fees. The unit economics depend on transaction volume and user engagement, which need to be verified further. (Assumption, Confidence: Low)
