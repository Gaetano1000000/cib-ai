The group includes Ferrara Candy Company, Fine Biscuits Company, and Fox's Burton's Company UK, companies operating in the Americas, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia with 25 production facilities.\n\nThe financial year closed with consolidated revenues of €3 billion, with a gross margin of €890 million, which - a statement explains - \"reflects the Group's solid operating base and demonstrates financial resilience with robust cash flow.\"\n\nThe discontinuity of the fiscal year, in which the previous consolidated financial statements referred to a 20-month period, makes a direct comparison with the current operating results, represented over 12 months, irrelevant.\n\nDuring the period, the group's average global workforce reached 12,882 employees. \"Growth,\" the statement continues, \"was driven by solid organic performance and strategic acquisitions, confirming the continued success of the entrepreneurial vision and strategy led by shareholder **Giovanni Ferrero.\"**\n\n“Our performance this year demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business,” said **Guido Giannotta** , Director of Cth Invest SA. “Despite a year characterized by a challenging economic environment, fluctuating raw material prices, and global inflationary pressures, we achieved solid growth, strengthened our market position in the candy and cookie categories, and made progress in key geographic markets. We also successfully completed the acquisitions of Dori Alimentos in Brazil, Jelly Belly Candy Company in the United States, and Michel et Augustin in France, strengthening our international presence. After the close of the financial year, we finalized the acquisition of Nonni's Bakery in the United States on October 1, 2024.

The now $425 million project will increase capacity of its current ice cream production, create new capabilities for future innovation, and add a first-of-its-kind chocolate manufacturing facility within the plant to use for ingredients in its ice cream and novelty products. This investment will enable the company to add 270 new jobs and retain approximately 380 full-time jobs. It will be one of the largest single private investments ever made in Chautauqua County. New York State is supporting the project with up to $12 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits and a $6 million grant from Empire State Development in exchange for job creation and capital investment commitments. The County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency is also working with the management team of Wells to provide support that will expedite the project.\n\n“We are building momentum in Chautauqua County’s manufacturing sector, with multiple companies growing and creating hundreds of new jobs in Dunkirk and the region,” **Governor Hochul said.**“The expansion of the Wells Enterprises is an important win, and we're transforming a struggling plant into a high-tech facility that will benefit New York workers, local business partners, and the region’s hard-working dairy farmers.\"\n\n**Wells Enterprises CEO Liam Killeen said,** “We couldn’t be more excited about the future of Wells and the role this expansion in Dunkirk will play in our ambition to be the U.S. ice cream category leader. We are extremely grateful to the State of New York, Chautauqua County, and the community of Dunkirk for their unwavering support of our growth. Most importantly, this is testament to the leadership and commitment of every one of our team members in Dunkirk. Their passion, drive, and excellence in operations are truly what makes this possible.”\n\nGovernor Hochul Celebrates Wells Enterprises' Expanded Investment at its Dunkirk Ice Cream Facility - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Governor Kathy Hochul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJp4eSJgbFroNySGthEiqA?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.governor.ny.gov%2F)\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul\n\n9.18K subscribers\n\n[Governor Hochul Celebrates Wells Enterprises' Expanded Investment at its Dunkirk Ice Cream Facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16vppMEVPzI)\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The facility’s production capabilities are expected to increase output to more than four times their current production to support the company’s growth in novelty and packaged ice cream. The newly announced expansion plans include all new production lines, more than doubling the number of manufacturing lines with high-output capabilities, creating new innovation capabilities, a new chocolate ingredient manufacturing facility, and best-in-class breakrooms, offices, and facilities designed to provide the best working environment for their team. Construction has already begun on the new facility. Wells is continuing to manufacture ice cream products in the existing facility while construction is underway.\n\nThe company’s growth will also benefit the dairy industry in the northeast. The planned expansion will continue to utilize millions of pounds of dairy annually. That number is expected to grow along with the overall consumption of ice cream. _Fortune Business Insights_ estimates theglobal ice cream market will reach $132.32 billion in 2032, up from $76.11 billion in 2023 and reflecting the overall increase in the world’s craving for ice cream.\n\nNew York State has nearly 3,000 dairy farms that produce over 15 billion pounds of milk annually, making New York the nation's fifth largest dairy state. Additionally, New York ranks 4th nationally in ice cream manufacturing with 51 payrolled business locations ranking the state 3rd in ice cream production in the nation.\n\nLast year the Ferrero Group, a global leader in sweet, packaged foods with leading brands like Nutella, Tic Tac, Ferrero Rocher and others, acquired Wells Enterprises, Inc. Wells is the largest privately held ice cream manufacturer in the United States. Founded in 1913 by Fred H. Wells and run by the Wells family for generations, the company is now an independent operating company of the Ferrero Group.  Wells produces more than 200 million gallons of ice cream per year and distributes products in all 50 states. Wells employs over 4,000 employees across the country. The company is headquartered in Le Mars, Iowa, and operates multiple manufacturing plants, including the Dunkirk facility, located at 1 Ice Cream Drive. These facilities play an important role in the company’s expansion plans for its national manufacturing network of its Blue\n\n### SOURCE 10\nURL: https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/2025-atlanta-500-business/\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/atlantamag \"Facebook\")[Instagram](http://instagram.com/atlantamagazine \"Instagram\")[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlantamagazine \"Linkedin\")[Twitter](https://twitter.com/atlantamagazine \"Twitter\")\n\n- [News/Culture](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture/)\n -
