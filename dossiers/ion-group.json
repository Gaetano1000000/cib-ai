The company has expanded rapidly through a series of [acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions \"Mergers and acquisitions\"). The _[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times \"Financial Times\")_ has compared it to [Bloomberg L.P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P. \"Bloomberg L.P.\") although it has a low profile.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:0-1)\n\n## Background\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ION_Group&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Background\")\\]\n\nAfter studying at the [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna \"University of Bologna\") **,** [Andrea Pignataro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Pignataro \"Andrea Pignataro\") later received a doctorate in mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London \"Imperial College London\"). He then worked as a bond trader in London. While working at [Salomon Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Brothers \"Salomon Brothers\"), Pignataro led a [joint venture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture \"Joint venture\") with [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa \"Pisa\")-based software firm List Holdings. The business would become Ion Trading UK, the start of ION.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:3-2)\n\nIn 1999, Andrea Pignataro left Salomon Brothers in London to establish ION as an independent company.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:0-1)[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:3-2) Pignataro also founded an investment firm with fellow traders after leaving Salomon Brothers but by the early 2000s, he was fully focused on Ion.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:3-2)\n\nIn June 2004, [TA Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TA_Associates \"TA Associates\") made its initial investment in Ion for $44 million. It would make additional investments later for a cumulative sum of $200 million.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:1-3)\n\nIon has expanded through a series of acquisitions, and between 2005 and 2019, Ion had acquired 20 companies reaching an [enterprise value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_value \"Enterprise value\") of £7 billion in November 2019.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:0-1)\n\nOn 31 May 2016 [The Carlyle Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carlyle_Group \"The Carlyle Group\") announced it would acquire a [minority interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_interest \"Minority interest\") in Ion for $400 million. The following month, it was reported that Ion would buy out TA Associates' stake to fund its growth. TA Associates reportedly made almost four times its investment from the sale of its stake in Ion.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:1-3)\n\nIn November 2017, [Euromoney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delinian \"Delinian\") sold its 15.5% stake in [Dealogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealogic \"Dealogic\") to Ion for $135 million which gave Ion a controlling stake.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-4)\n\nIn April 2018, Ion acquired [Fidessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidessa \"Fidessa\") for £1.5 billion by outbidding [Temenos AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenos_AG \"Temenos AG\"). The deal came just hours before the deadline set by [The Takeover Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Takeover_Panel \"The Takeover Panel\"). The deal was to enable Ion to enter the equities and derivatives markets. Ion stated it had been provided with only \"limited due diligence access\" with regards to Fidessa and would carry out a deeper review once the deal was completed.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-5)\n\nIn April 2019, Ion acquired [Allegro Development Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro_Development_Corporation \"Allegro Development Corporation\") from Vector Capital and Cerium Technology.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-6)\n\nIn May 2019, Ion acquired [Acuris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acuris \"Acuris\") from [BC Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Partners \"BC Partners\") for £1.35 billion to expand its product offerings for [capital markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market \"Capital market\").[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-7)\n\nThere were talks of a plan to combine Ion with [Nasdaq, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq,_Inc. \"Nasdaq, Inc.\") in 2019. However they ended without an agreement because of concerns about whether the two would fit together. Following this and another failed bid for a financial services software business in Switzerland, Pignataro decided to consolidate control of Ion by taking out loans to buy out Carlyle's stake. After this Ion started investing in various Italian finance related companies such as Cedacri and Cerved.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ION_Group#cite_note-:3-2)\n\nIn 2020, Ion acquired Broadway Technology but the [Competition and Markets Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority \"Competition and Markets Authority\") blocked Ion from buying the fixed income business of Broadway Technology due to competition concerns. Eventually the Broadway Technology deal proceeded with Bloomberg L.P acquirin\n\n### SOURCE 4\nURL:

Review\n\n1.0\n\nJan 11, 2018\n\nConsultant\n\nFormer employee, more than 5 years\n\nNew York, NY\n\nRecommend\n\nCEO approval\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nPros\n\nI can honestly say that the only Pro was the office views.\n\nCons\n\nThere are a lot of CONs to this company... hence why it was the worst company I've ever worked for...\n\nFor one, I worked at Reval which is a Treasury Management System (TMS) that got acquired by ION Group. When we found out that we were acquired by ION, there was a sense of panic amongst the team - not because we were being acquired but because we were being acquired by ION. There were rumors that ION acquires companies and basically guts them (no promotion, no raises, no bonuses etc.)...\n\nWhen we came over to ION, the CEO (Andrea Pignataro) never welcomed us or even addressed us. In fact, the people that were already at ION did not even know what was happening until the day we moved in (apparently they laid off a bunch of their employees to make room for us). Slowly, people from the Reval team began to leave 1 by 1... We were promised promotions and raises but after the turn of the year, nothing ever came. Apparently, they were being reviewed by the CEO who never gave us an answer. Months go by and people try to stick around with the false hopes that we'd get the promotions/raises that we deserved. After a YEAR goes by, still no answer. Now, the management team of Reval begins to leave and that's when you know it's hitting rock bottom.\n\nThere was absolutely no communication from upper management. And from the looks of it, it seemed like they really didn't care that people were leaving. They made no attempt to retain any sort of talent.\n\nIf you're looking to join the ION team, please don't. Save yourself. You will sit at your desk regretting the decision to join this company.\n\nIf you're part of a company that was acquired by ION, start looking for a new job. Don't believe the things they say about the smooth transition into ION nor how things are going to stay the same. They won't. We were fed the same story...\n\nAlso read the reviews for ION Trading. You can also read the reviews of the companies that they acquired - Reval, Wall Street Systems, Treasura, Triple Point etc.\n\nFor the love of God, stay away from this company. I would not even recommend this company to people I hate...\n\nShow more\n\nHelpful\n\nShare\n\n33\n\n## Explore other reviews about ION Group\n\n5.0\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\nProduct analyst\n\nFormer employee\n\nRecommend\n\nCEO approval\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nPros\n\nGood culture, flexible career options, work-life balance\n\nCons\n\nA little difficult to pivot into different teams\n\nHelpful\n\nShare\n\n3.0\n\nJan 20, 2026\n\nAnonymous employee\n\nCurrent employee\n\nRecommend\n\nCEO approval\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nPros\n\nVery intelligent and helpful coworkers, constantly learning new technology, free LinkedIn learning accounts, decent benefits\n\nCons\n\nSalary stagnant - for years.

a raft of questions about the quality of its revenues and insider stock sales following [a report published today](https://www.wolfpackresearch.com/items/ionq-has-lost-funding-for-vital-pentagon-contracts-that-had-represented-up-to-86%2525-of-revenues-) by short-seller Wolfpack Research.\n\nWolfpack, which is short IonQ’s stock and thus stands to gain financially from its allegations, said that the company has consistently misled investors about the extent to which there is organic demand for its quantum computing technology.\n\nIn particular, the Wolfpack report said the company did not disclose to investors the extent to which its reported revenues had been dependent on “backdoor earmarks” inserted into the Pentagon budget by friendly lawmakers—and that those earmarks were canceled after the Republicans took control of Congress in 2025.\n\nAfter _Fortune’_ s deadline to publish, IonQ provided this statement: “\\[The Wolfpack Research report\\] contains false, misleading, and unsubstantiated claims from a short-seller that is attempting to profit by driving down the price of IonQ shares. The report has substantial misrepresentations as to IonQ’s government relationships, business strategy, and financial sustainability. IonQ is continuing to advance our position as the world’s leading quantum company. We have a clear path to shareholder value creation, and our recent agreement to acquire SkyWater Technology is evidence that IonQ is a trusted ecosystem partner to the U.S. government, allied nations, and industry collaborators.”\n\nIonQ was worth more than $13.8 billion before the start of trading Wednesday. Following publication of the Wolfpack research, its shares dropped more than 11% before recovering slightly. As of market close Wednesday, they were down about 8%.\n\nThe short-seller’s research raises questions about one of the most prominent companies in a highly hyped sector. While a number of Big Tech companies, including [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/), [Microsoft](https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/), and [IBM](https://fortune.com/company/ibm/), have made significant scientific breakthroughs in quantum computing over the past few years, the technology is only in the earliest stages of commercial adoption.\n\nRecommended Video\n\n* * *\n\nA handful of companies have done pilot projects showing that it is possible to use a quantum computer to speed up how long it takes to make complex calculations, such as optimizing delivery routes or calculating the risk profile of a large financial portfolio. But few of these use cases have yet progressed beyond the pilot phase. There are several fundamentally different ways of building quantum computers, and there remains active debate among scientists about which technologies will ultimately prove commercially viable.\n\nIonQ admitted these challenges last November in its [most recent quarterly report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312525266942/ionq-20250930.htm#notes_to_conden_conso_financial_stateme), where it warned: “We have not produced a scalable quantum computer and face significant barriers in our attempts to produce quantum computers. If we cannot successfully overcome those barriers, our business will be negatively impacted and could fail.”\n\nSuch obstacles have not stopped a few quantum startups from selling shares on the public markets, often through reverse mergers with blank-check “special purpose acquisition companies” or SPACs. IonQ did its own SPAC deal in the autumn of 2021; since then its share price has more than tripled.\n\nIn a conversation with _Fortune_ on Jan. 28—prior to the release of the Wolfpack report—CEO Niccolo de Masi insisted that IonQ was in fact already selling quantum machinery to commercial partners.\n\nHe cited [a partnership](https://investors.ionq.com/news/news-details/2025/IonQ-Speeds-Quantum-Accelerated-Drug-Development-Application-With-AstraZeneca-AWS-and-NVIDIA/default.aspx) last year with [Nvidia](https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/) and [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) Web Services to provide hybrid quantum-classical computing services to [AstraZeneca](https://fortune.com/company/astrazeneca/) that would make “computational drug design” 20-fold faster than before. “It’s turning a month of computational work into a day and a half, and that was using hardware from 2024,” de Masi said.\n\nSpeaking a few days after completing IonQ’s [$1.8 billion acquisition of SkyWater](https://investors.ionq.com/news/news-details/2026/IonQ-to-Acquire-SkyWater-Technology-Creating-the-Only-Vertically-Integrated-Full-Stack-Quantum-Platform-Company/default.aspx), a computer chip foundry, de Masi also poured scorn on rival quantum companies, whom he believes do not have viable products. “There are large companies in the quantum computing space who say that they’re in the race—and they’re roughly where we were in 2001! But they will still talk to journalists and say they’re in the race. And you’re like, ‘You’re in the race the way Graphcore is in the race with Nvidia,’” he said. (Graphcore is a U.K. AI chip startup that struggled to gain market share and was acquired by SoftBank in 2024.)\n\n“If\n\n### SOURCE 7\nURL: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250609933087/en/IonQ-Announces-Agreement-to-Acquire-Oxford-Ionics-Accelerating-Path-to-Pioneering-Breakthroughs-in-Quantum-Computing\n\nJun 9, 2025 4:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time\n\n# **IonQ Announces Agreement to Acquire Oxford Ionics, Accelerating Path to Pioneering Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing**\n\nShare\n\n* * *\n\n_Deal builds on the strategic cooperation between the United States and United Kingdom to unlock next-generation technologies, and enhances Oxford Ionics’ position as a global hub for quantum computing R&D_\n\n_Combined entity intends to deliver the world’s most powerful quantum computers by bringing together complementary technologies_\n\n_The combination is expected to accelerate innovation in drug discovery, materials science, financial modeling, logistics, chemistry, aerospace, cybersecurity and defense_\n\n[![original ](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250609933087/en/2491925/4/IonQ-Oxford_Ionics_Logo_lockup.jpg?download=1)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250609933087/en/2491925/5/IonQ-Oxford_Ionics_Logo_lockup.jpg?download=1)\n\n[Download media](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250609933087/en/2491925/5/IonQ-Oxford_Ionics_Logo_lockup.jpg?download=1)\n\n![thumbnail ](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250609933087/en/2491925/4/IonQ-Oxford_Ionics_Logo_lockup.jpg)![thumbnail ](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250609933087/en/1956987/4/IonQ_logo.jpg)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. & OXFORD, England--( [BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) and Oxford Ionics today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for IonQ to acquire Oxford Ionics in a transaction valued at $1.075 Billion, which will consist of $1.065 Billion in shares of IonQ common stock and approximately $10 Million in cash (subject to customary closing adjustments and expenses).\n\nIonQ is a leader in quantum computing and networking, developing high performance systems based on trapped ion technology, to help solve the world’s most complex commercial and research challenges. Oxford Ionics holds the current world records for fidelity, which measures the accuracy of quantum operations.\n\nThe transaction will bring together IonQ’s quantum compute, application and networking stack with Oxford Ionics’ groundbreaking ion-trap technology manufactured on standard semiconductor chips. The combined technologies are expected to deliver innovative, reliable quantum computers that increase in power, scale, and problem-solving capabilities. Both companies expect to benefit from the other’s complementary technologies, deep expertise, and IonQ’s global resources and established customer base.\n\nThe combined company expects to build systems with 256 physical qubits at accuracies of 99.99% by 2026 and advance to over 10,000 physical qubits with logical accuracies of 99.99999% by 2027. The combined company anticipates extending its innovation by reaching 2 million physical qubits in its quantum computers by 2030, enabling logical qubit accuracies exceeding 99.9999999999%.\n\nThe quantum computing market is projected to create up to $850 billion of global economic value by 2040 according to Boston Consulting Group. The management teams believe the transaction will enable the combined company to pioneer breakthroughs in quantum computing. IonQ expects that combining with Oxford Ionics will help drive the creation of disruptive applications that enable substantial revenue growth opportunities.\n\nOxford Ionics’ team is expected to play a vital role in the combined company's future. Both Oxford Ionics founders, Dr. Chris Ballance and Dr. Tom Harty, are expected to remain with IonQ after the acquisition is completed, continuing their pioneering work on quantum technology development in the UK. The combined entity also plans to expand its workforce in Oxford to further develop the UK's position as a leader in quantum computing.\n\nThe combined company expects to maintain all existing customer relationships, including government partnerships in both the UK and US. The company also plans to continue working with the UK National Quantum Computing Centre and the government's Quantum Missions program, driven by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology and Innovate UK, helping to develop practical quantum computing applications in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and defense.\n\n“IonQ’s vision has always been to drive real-world impact in every era and year of quantum computing’s growth.

The company is pursuing scalable quantum computing via a proposed acquisition of Oxford Ionics, aiming for 10,000 physical qubits with 99.99999% logical fidelity by 2027 and 2 million physical qubits by 2030, complemented by completed acquisitions of Lightsynq – leveraging photonic interconnect technologies for qubit scaling – and Capella, supporting a space-based quantum key distribution (QKD) network.\n\nCollaborative efforts include a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with KISTI and AIST to advance quantum infrastructure and research, partnerships with Einride and Emergence Quantum focused on quantum-enhanced optimization and Australian quantum capabilities, and support for the Texas Quantum Initiative, alongside a $22 million agreement with EPB to establish a commercial quantum hub; technical achievements include a 20x speed-up in drug development via collaboration with AstraZeneca, AWS, and NVIDIA, joint simulations with the University of Washington concerning matter-antimatter asymmetry, and power grid efficiency improvements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Niccolo de Masi was appointed Chairman, succeeding Peter Chapman, while Marco Pistoia, Rick Muller, and Paul Dacier joined as Senior Vice President of Industry Relations, Vice President of Quantum Systems, and Chief Legal Officer, respectively, with Chris Monroe assuming the role of Chief Scientific Advisor.\n\n## Financial Performance and Strategy\n\nIonQ’s second quarter financial performance demonstrates substantial growth, reporting revenue of $20. 7 million, exceeding prior guidance by 15%. This revenue increase, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet following a $1 billion equity financing – bringing pro-forma cash, cash equivalents, and investments to $1.6 billion as of July 9, 2025 – underpins the company’s aggressive expansion strategy.\n\nWhile a net loss of $177. 5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $36 million were reported; these figures are consistent with the capital-intensive nature of quantum computing development and reflect significant investment in research and development, as well as strategic acquisitions. The company’s financial outlook for the full year 2025 projects revenue between $82 million and $100 million, indicating continued, albeit substantial, investment in achieving technological milestones. A central tenet of IonQ’s strategy is the consolidation of expertise through acquisitions, most notably the proposed acquisition of [Oxford Ionics](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/airbus-partners-with-oxford-ionics-to-develop-quantum-fluid-dynamics/), aimed at accelerating progress in scalable [quantum computing](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/10-coursera-online-quantum-courses-for-learning-quantum-computing-in-2025/).\n\nThis follows the completed acquisitions of Lightsynq and Capella, each contributing unique capabilities to IonQ’s roadmap. Lightsynq’s photonic interconnect technologies are particularly crucial, addressing a key challenge in scaling quantum systems – the need for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between qubits. Capella’s expertise in infrastructure development supports the creation of a space-based [quantum key distribution (QKD)](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/speqtral-and-toshiba-digital-solutions-corporation-toshiba-collaborate-to-bring-quantum-key-distribution-qkd/) network, a critical component for secure quantum communication and a potential revenue stream. These acquisitions demonstrate a deliberate effort to build a vertically integrated quantum computing ecosystem.\n\nIonQ’s ambitious technical roadmap anticipates achieving 10,000 physical qubits with 99. 99999% logical fidelity by 2027 and 2 million physical qubits by 2030. This projection relies on advancements in qubit coherence, fidelity, and connectivity, alongside the integration of technologies acquired through strategic mergers. The company’s collaborations with leading research institutions – including the University of Washington, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, KISTI (South Korea), and AIST (Japan) – are instrumental in driving these advancements.\n\nThese partnerships facilitate joint research and development, access to advanced facilities, and the exchange of expertise, accelerating the pace of innovation. Furthermore, IonQ’s $22 million deal with EPB to establish America’s first commercial quantum hub signifies a commitment to translating research into practical applications and fostering a quantum-ready workforce. The appointment of Niccolo de Masi as Chairman of the Board, succeeding Peter Chapman, reflects confidence in his leadership since becoming CEO in February 2025. Complementing this, the strengthening of the leadership team with appointments such as Marco Pistoia (Senior Vice President of Industry Relations), Rick Muller (Vice President of Quantum Systems), Paul Dacier (Chief Legal Officer), and Chris Monroe (Chief Scientific Advisor) demonstrates a strategic focus on building a robust and experienced management structure.\n\nThese individuals bring diverse expertise in areas critical to IonQ’s success, including business development, quantum hardware, legal compliance, and scientific leadership. IonQ’s Adjusted EBITDA metric, defined as net loss excluding specific items, provides investors with an alternative measure of operating performance, although the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures remains crucial for transparent financial reporting.\n\n## Expansion and Partnerships\n\nIonQ’s strategic expansion is demonstrably underpinned by a series of acquisitions and international partnerships designed to accelerate progress towards scalable quantum computing. The proposed acquisition of [Oxford Ionics](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/airbus-partners-with-oxford-ionics-to-develop-quantum-fluid-dynamics/) is central to this strategy, aiming to synergise IonQ’s trapped-ion technology with Oxford Ionics’ expertise in nuclear spin qubits, a potentially advantageous approach for enhancing qubit coherence and fidelity. This consolidation is projected to yield a substantial increase in qubit count – reaching 10,000 physical qubits with 99. 99999% logical fidelity by 2027, and scaling to 2 million physical qubits by 2030 – a significant leap be\n"
